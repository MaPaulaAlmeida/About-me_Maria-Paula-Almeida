# About me: María Paula Almeida

**Aplicações Web:** Trabalho de Casa #2 - Almeida María Paula.

When introducing myself, the first step is to provide some general information: My full name is María Paula Basantes Almeida. I was born on January 9, 2006, in the city of Quito, Ecuador. I am currently 18 years old and pursuing a degree in Audiovisual Communication and Multimedia at a university in Porto, Portugal.

Coming to Portugal meant fulfilling my dream of studying abroad, a goal I have had since I was very young. I have been in Portugal for four months, during which I completed an intensive Portuguese language course in Leiria. Afterward, I moved to Porto, where I have just started university.

My younger self wouldn’t believe how far I am from home and my family. However, I’m living this unique experience to the fullest; discovering more about myself, defining my future goals, taking on new challenges, and expanding my worldview every day.

To conclude this brief text about myself, I’d like to end with a phrase that has guided me on this new path: *:sparkles:Embrace uncertainty:sparkles:*
