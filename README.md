# About me: María Paula Almeida

**Aplicações Web:** Trabalho de Casa #2 - Almeida María Paula.

When introducing myself, the first step is to provide some general information: My full name is María Paula Basantes Almeida. I was born on January 9, 2006, in the city of Quito, Ecuador. I am currently 18 years old and pursuing a degree in Audiovisual Communication and Multimedia at a university in Porto, Portugal.

Coming to Portugal meant achieving my dream of studying abroad, a desire I had since I was pretty young. I have been in Portugal for four months since in that time I took an intensive Portuguese language course in Leiria. Then I moved to Porto and just started university.
