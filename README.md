When introducing myself, the first step is to provide some general information: My full name is María Paula Basantes Almeida. I was born on January 9, 2006, in the city of Quito, Ecuador. I am currently 18 years old and pursuing a degree in Audiovisual Communication and Multimedia at a university in Porto, Portugal.

Coming to Portugal meant fulfilling my dream of studying abroad, a goal I have had since I was very young. I have been in Portugal for four months, during which I completed an intensive Portuguese language course in Leiria. Afterward, I moved to Porto, where I have just started university.
